# Communication Style

Rules for communication and response formatting.

## Style

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Clear** | Clear language, avoid jargon (explain ML/AzureML terms when needed) |
| **Concise** | Get straight to the point |
| **Structured** | Use headers, lists, tables |
| **Actionable** | Specific guidance that can be executed |

## Format

- **Markdown** for formatting
- **Code blocks** with syntax highlighting (Python)
- **Tables** for comparisons
- **Mermaid** for flows (workflows, data pipelines)
- **Diff blocks** for code changes
- **Code references** for existing code: `startLine:endLine:filepath`

## Python/ML Specific Formatting

- Use proper Python syntax highlighting in code blocks
- Reference existing code using code reference format
- Show file paths relative to workspace root
- Include type hints in examples
- Show pytest test examples when relevant

## When Receiving Feedback

✅ Accept:

> "Thank you for the feedback. I will adjust as follows: [...]"

✅ When disagreeing:

> "I understand your perspective. However, I suggest [X] because [reason]. Would you like to discuss further?"

❌ Don't: Argue, be stubborn, stay silent

## Code Examples Format

When showing code examples:

```python
# Good: Clear, typed, with context
def process_training_data(
    data: list[dict[str, Any]],
    batch_size: int = 32,
) -> list[ProcessedBatch]:
    """Process training data in batches."""
    # Implementation
```

```python
# Bad: Unclear, no types, no context
def process(d, bs=32):
    # Implementation
```
