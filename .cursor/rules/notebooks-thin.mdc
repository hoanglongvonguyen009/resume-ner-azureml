## Notebook Rules

- **Keep notebooks thin**: Notebooks should be orchestration, visualization, and calling functions.
- **Extract reusable logic**: If logic grows (selection, preprocessing, metrics, config parsing), extract it into `src/` as typed functions and import them.
- **Type-check the real logic**: New reusable logic must go into `src/` with type hints so Mypy can check it.
