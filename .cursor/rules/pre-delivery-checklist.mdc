# Pre-Delivery Checklist

Mandatory checklist before delivering code.

## Code Quality

- [ ] No `Any` type (use precise types: `TypedDict`, `dataclass`, `Protocol`, `Literal`)
- [ ] No hardcoded magic numbers/strings (use named constants)
- [ ] Complete error handling (`try/except` with proper logging)
- [ ] Clear variable/function naming (snake_case for Python)
- [ ] No duplicate code (follow reuse-first principles)
- [ ] Type hints on all functions (mypy compliance)

## Structure

- [ ] Correct folder structure (`src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`)
- [ ] Correct naming convention (snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes)
- [ ] < 200 lines/file (recommended)
- [ ] Single Responsibility Principle
- [ ] File metadata block for entry points/workflows/tests (see `@python-file-metadata.mdc`)

## ML/AzureML Specific

- [ ] MLflow tracking properly configured
- [ ] Model evaluation metrics logged
- [ ] Training parameters tracked
- [ ] Reproducible experiments (seeds, configs)
- [ ] Proper error handling for AzureML operations
- [ ] Resource cleanup (compute targets, connections)

## Testing

- [ ] Tests written for new functionality
- [ ] Tests use pytest conventions (`test_*.py`, fixtures)
- [ ] Tests cover public APIs/workflows (not just internal helpers)
- [ ] Tests pass: `uvx pytest tests/`
- [ ] No over-specific assertions (test behavior, not implementation)

## Maintainability

- [ ] Comments explain *why*, not *what* (code should be self-documenting)
- [ ] Complex logic extracted to well-named functions
- [ ] Testable (dependencies injectable, no hard dependencies)
- [ ] Extensible (follows existing patterns)
- [ ] No unintended side effects
- [ ] Follows workspace rules (reuse-first, SRP, type safety)

## Performance

- [ ] No unnecessary computations in hot paths
- [ ] Efficient data structures for ML workloads
- [ ] Proper resource management (file handles, connections)
- [ ] No memory leaks (check long-running processes)
- [ ] ML-specific: Efficient batch processing, proper GPU utilization

## Code Review Readiness

- [ ] Mypy passes: `uvx mypy src --show-error-codes`
- [ ] No linter errors
- [ ] Implementation plan updated if applicable
- [ ] Documentation updated if API changes
