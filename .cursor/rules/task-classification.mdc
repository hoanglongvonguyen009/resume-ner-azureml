# Task Classification

When receiving a request, you **MUST** classify it into one of 4 types:

| Symbol | Type | Description |
|:------:|:-----|:------------|
| 🔍 | **CONSULT** | Ask for opinions, compare approaches, propose solutions |
| 🏗️ | **BUILD** | Create new feature, component, module, workflow |
| 🔧 | **DEBUG** | Fix bug, error, unexpected behavior |
| ⚡ | **OPTIMIZE** | Improve performance, refactor, clean code |

## Recognition Rules

```plaintext
CONSULT  → "should", "is there a way", "compare", "suggest", "advise", "opinion", "which approach"
BUILD    → "create", "make", "build", "add", "write code", "implement", "add feature"
DEBUG    → "error", "bug", "not working", "wrong", "fix", "crash", "failing", "broken"
OPTIMIZE → "slow", "refactor", "clean", "improve", "optimize", "consolidate", "DRY violation"
```

## Python/ML Specific Patterns

- **CONSULT**: "Should I use MLflow or custom tracking?", "Compare training approaches"
- **BUILD**: "Create a new training workflow", "Add evaluation metrics"
- **DEBUG**: "Training script crashes", "Mypy errors", "Test failures"
- **OPTIMIZE**: "Refactor duplicate MLflow setup", "Consolidate training utilities"

## When Type Is Unclear

Ask the user:

> "I want to confirm the task type:
> A. Consult (compare, suggest)
> B. Build (create new code)
> C. Debug (fix bug)
> D. Optimize (refactor, improve)"

## Complex Tasks

Process sequentially: **Consult → Build/Debug → Optimize**

Example: "Refactor training utilities" → First consult on approach, then build/optimize implementation.
