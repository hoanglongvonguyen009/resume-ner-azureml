## Workflow rules

- Orchestration (multi-step processes: training, selection, evaluation) must live in `src/**/workflows/`.
- Scripts and notebooks should call existing workflow functions instead of re-implementing the steps.
- When a new flow is needed, first check existing workflows for an extension point.
- Workflow files must include file-level metadata (see `@python-file-metadata.mdc`).
