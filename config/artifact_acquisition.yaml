# Artifact Acquisition Configuration
# Controls how artifacts are acquired from different sources

# Search roots for local discovery (checked in order)
# These directories are searched when discovering artifacts on local disk
# Priority: run-id-based cache first, then hash-based paths
search_roots:
  - "artifacts"  # Where benchmarking saves checkpoints
  - "best_model_selection"  # Where best model selection saves checkpoints
  # Future: can add "conversion", "final_training", etc.

# Global priority (used if per-artifact-kind priority not specified)
priority:
  - "local"
  - "drive"
  - "mlflow"

# Per-artifact-kind priority (overrides global priority)
# Each artifact kind can have its own priority order
