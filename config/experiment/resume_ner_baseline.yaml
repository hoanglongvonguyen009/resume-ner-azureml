# High-level orchestration design:
# - Stages: smoke → hpo → training
# - Each stage can target a specific set of backbones
# - AML experiment names are per-stage, optionally per-backbone

stages:
  smoke:
    # AML experiment base name for smoke tests
    aml_experiment: "resume-ner-smoke"
    # Backbones to include in the smoke stage
    backbones:
      - "distilbert"
      - "deberta"

  hpo:
    # AML experiment base name for HPO sweeps
    aml_experiment: "resume-ner-hpo"
    # Backbones to include in HPO (usually a subset/superset of smoke)
    backbones:
      - "distilbert"
      - "deberta"

  training:
    # AML experiment base name for final single-run training
    aml_experiment: "resume-ner-train"
    # Final production backbone(s); typically one chosen after HPO
    backbones:
      - "distilbert"

# Optional naming policy for how AML experiments are derived per backbone.
# If true, the orchestrator should build experiment_name as:
#   "<aml_experiment>-<backbone>"
# otherwise it should use "<aml_experiment>" directly and rely on tags
# (stage/backbone) for grouping in AML.
